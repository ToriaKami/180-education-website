    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>My work is built on a simple premise: talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn't. I act as a bridge, ensuring that every dollar a company wants to invest in education finds its way to a student who needs it most. I partner with generous businesses to design and establish meaningful scholarships, then work with my network of universities and colleges to place that funding directly into the hands of their student services teams.</p>
    
    <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
    <p>My passion for this mission is deeply personal. I'm currently navigating my own degree path in English Literature at the University of Michigan, balancing part-time work with my studies. I know the pressure of making tuition ends meet because I live it every day.</p>
    
    <p>When I’m not focused on this work, you can find me in Ann Arbor, Michigan—the town I’ve always called home. Life here is shared with my partner, Jess (a brilliant graphic designer with a scary talent for Mario Kart), and our rescue beagle, Theo, who firmly believes every walk should be a grand expedition.</p>
    
    <p>This work is more than just a freelance gig; it's a project dedicated to making higher education a little more attainable for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
    <p>If you're a company ready to give back or a school looking for new funding opportunities, I would love to chat. You can reach me directly at: <strong>harper@180Education.org</strong></p>
