                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>My process is designed to be simple and seamless. It starts with a consultation where I learn about your company's values and goals. From there, I design a custom scholarship program, handle the outreach to my network of universities, manage the application process, and finally, connect you with the amazing students you'll be supporting. I handle the heavy lifting so you can focus on the impact.</p>

                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Beyond the immense satisfaction of changing a student's life, a well-managed scholarship program is a powerful tool. It enhances your brand's reputation as a socially responsible leader, helps you build a direct pipeline to future talent in your industry, and generates authentic goodwill within the community and among your own employees.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Universities in my network gain free, direct access to a curated set of scholarship opportunities they might not otherwise find. For students, it's a lifeline. It provides them with the vital funding needed to cover tuition, books, and materials, allowing them to focus on their studies and reduce financial stress.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely. In fact, I insist on it. A core part of my work is helping you design a scholarship that reflects what your company stands for. We can target students in a specific field of study, those from certain backgrounds, students who demonstrate a commitment to community service, or any other criteria that align with your mission.</p>

                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>This varies greatly depending on your goals. Some partners create multi-year, full-tuition programs, while others start with targeted book stipends or one-time awards. A meaningful program can be established with a commitment starting from a few thousand dollars. My focus is on helping you create the most impactful program possible within your budget.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No. My services are fully funded by the corporate partners who sponsor the scholarships. There is absolutely no cost to universities, colleges, or students to participate. My goal is to remove barriers to education, not create new ones.</p>
